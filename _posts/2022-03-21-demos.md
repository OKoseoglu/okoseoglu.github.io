<a href="https://en.demos.org.tr/about-us/who-we-are/" target="_blank">DEMOS</a> Research Association’s report <a href="https://demos.org.tr/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/from-converging-roads-to-narrowing-groun.pdf" target="_blank"><i>From Converging Roads to Narrowing Grounds: The Struggle for Peace by LGBTI+ and Women’s Organizations in Turkey</i></a> written by Güley Bor, Güneş Daşlı, and Nisan Alıcı, co-translated with Yaman Öğüt, and edited by Frances Mullings.

<i>Research Association for Democracy, Peace and Alternative Politics</i> (<a href="https://en.demos.org.tr/about-us/who-we-are/" target="_blank">DEMOS Research Association</a>) was founded in Ankara in 2015 by social scientists aiming to foreground a collective approach to knowledge production. Ever since its founding, it has conducted research within the broad purview of peace studies and examined examples from Turkey and abroad, adopting a gender perspective while doing so.

DEMOS envisions a society that has achieved societal peace, where all identities are considered equal. It produces and disseminates its research, analyses and translations to this end. DEMOS engages in critical and accessible knowledge production for and with rights subjects, as well as organisations, activists and researchers involved in the struggle for societal peace. It shares this knowledge through print and digital media, podcasts, conferences, workshops, seminars, etc., thus informing rights subjects and grassroots peace organizations of current debates, supporting them, and working towards collective empowerment with stakeholders themselves.
